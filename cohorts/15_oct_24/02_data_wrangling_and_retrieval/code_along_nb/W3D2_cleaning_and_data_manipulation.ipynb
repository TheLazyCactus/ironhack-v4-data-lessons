    "Null values (also known as missing values) are common in datasets and can hinder data analysis and modeling. It is essential to handle null values appropriately to ensure accurate and reliable results. Pandas provides various methods to clean and handle null values in datasets.\n",

    "In Python, `None` is a special constant that represents the absence of a value. It is commonly used to indicate that a variable or function has no value or hasn't been assigned any value. For example, if a function does not explicitly return a value, it implicitly returns `None`.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, `NaN` stands for \"Not a Number\" and is a special value used to represent missing or undefined numerical data. `NaN` is part of the floating-point representation and is commonly used in numeric data structures like Pandas DataFrames and Series to indicate missing or invalid numerical values."

    "When data is missing for reasons that have nothing to do with the information being recorded, i.e. has no connection to any data points in the dataset, whether observed or unobserved. This scenario happens when there's **a glitch in the system collecting the data**, rather than the data itself and there's no way to predict where values will be missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **Lost Surveys**: Say a surveyor accidentally dropped completed questionnaires into a lake. The fact that there's information missing from these specific questionnaires doesn’t depend on who filled them out or what they contained. The loss of data is completely random.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Sensor Failure in a Weather Station**: A weather station collects temperature data hourly, but sometimes the sensor fails from time to time, for no particular reason. Given these failures don’t depend on the time of day, season, or temperature, the missing values just happen randomly due to a technical issue. However, if the sensor failure was due to temperature, or rainfall, or **any other factor connected to the data being observed**, the data will no longer be MCAR but it would be **MAR**.  "

    "> Despite its name, MAR occurs when the absence of data is not random. The probability of missing data is not equal for all measurements. They’re more likely for some observations than others. However, measurements of observed variables predict the unequal probability of missing values occurring. ([Statistics by Jim](https://statisticsbyjim.com/basics/missing-data/))\n",

    "- **Medical Study Missing Data on a Drug’s Side Effects**: In a medical study, older participants might be more likely to drop out or miss follow-up appointments. As a result, we may be missing some follow-up data on side effects for older participants. The missing data is linked to an observable factor (age), but it’s not related to the unobserved side effect outcomes themselves.\n",

    "-  **Student Performance Data**: In a school, students may be more likely to skip reporting their test scores in optional evaluations. For instance, students with lower attendance rates might be more likely to miss submitting their scores. The missing test scores are related to an observed factor (attendance rate), not the missing test scores themselves. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Workplace Wellness Programs and Job Satisfaction**: Employees who are part-time might be less likely to participate in wellness programs, leading to missing data on wellness program engagement for part-time employees. The missing engagement data is related to observed information (employment status: part-time vs. full-time) rather than how much the part-time employees actually benefit from the program."

    "MNAR data means that the reason for missing data is related to the actual missing data itself, so it's not possible to predict where there will be missing values in the dataset as the information needed to do that is missing.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example:\n",
    "- **Sensitive Information in Surveys**: Suppose a survey asks people about their income, and higher-income individuals are more likely to skip the question due to privacy concerns. Here, the likelihood of a person not responding is directly related to the value of their income (higher income = more likely to skip). This is MNAR because the missing data (income) is missing specifically because of the value it would have been, not because of any other observed variable like age or occupation, although the latter could also be correlated with a high-income.    \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Health Studies and Sensitive Symptoms**: In a medical study, participants with more severe symptoms might skip reporting certain symptoms or drop out of the study because they’re uncomfortable sharing the extent of their condition. This missing data would be MNAR since people are missing from the dataset specifically because of their symptom severity, which we can’t observe directly once they’ve dropped out.   \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Employee Feedback and Job Satisfaction**: If a company survey asks employees about job satisfaction, those who are very dissatisfied may skip questions or avoid taking the survey altogether to avoid potential consequences. This situation would be MNAR because the likelihood of missing data (not answering the job satisfaction questions) is directly related to the unobserved values (job dissatisfaction). However, it could be linked to other factors, such as compensation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Credit Scores and Loan Applications**: In a financial study, people with very low credit scores might be less likely to report their scores or apply for loans, creating a gap in data. Since the missing data (credit scores) is related to the unobserved values (the actual low scores), this scenario would be classified as MNAR."

    "One of the primary tasks in dataset analysis is filtering rows.\n",
    "\n",
    "When filtering DataFrames in Pandas, you can use boolean indexing to select specific rows based on certain conditions. Here's a step-by-step explanation:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Identify the column(s) you want to use as a filter condition. For example, in `housing_df` the column named 'SalePrice'.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Create a condition using a comparison operator (e.g., `>`, `<`, `==`, etc.) and the column(s) you want to filter. For instance, to filter all rows where the 'SalePrice' is greater than 10000, you would use `condition = housing_df['SalePrice'] > 10000`.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Use the condition to filter the DataFrame. You can do this by passing the condition inside square brackets to the DataFrame. For example, `filtered_df = housing_df[condition]` will create a new DataFrame `filtered_df` containing only the rows where the 'SalePrice' is greater than 10000.\n",
    "\n",
    "Keep in mind that the condition should evaluate to a boolean Series with the same length as the DataFrame, indicating which rows to include (True) or exclude (False).\n",
    "\n",
    "You can also combine multiple conditions using logical operators like `&` for 'and' and `|` for 'or'. For instance, to filter rows where the 'SalePrice' is greater than 10000 and the 'FullBath' is more than 1, you can use `condition = (housing_df['SalePrice'] > 10000) & (housing_df['FullBath'] > 1)`.\n",

    "   - Null values (also known as missing values) can hinder data analysis and modeling.\n",
    "   - Use `isnull()` or `isna()` to check for null values in a DataFrame or Series.\n",
    "   - Use `any()` and `sum()` to efficiently assess data quality.\n",
    "   - Use `dropna()` to remove rows or columns with null values from a DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Parameters like subset, how, and thresh can control the behavior of dropping rows or columns.\n",
    "   - Use `fillna()` to replace null values with specific values, such as `mean()`, `median()`, or forward/backward fill.\n",
    "\n",
    "5. Formatting Data:\n",
    "   - Use `round()` and `format()` to format numeric values.\n",
    "   - Use string methods like `lower()`, `upper()`, `title()`, `strip()`, `split()`, and `replace()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "6. Cleaning Column Names:\n",
    "   - Use df.columns to access column names.\n",
    "   - Modify column names using df.columns or `rename()`.\n",
    "\n",
    "7. Using `apply()`, `map()`, and `applymap()`:\n",
    "   - `apply()`: Applies a custom function to a Series.\n",
    "   - `map()`: Transforms Series elements based on a dictionary.\n",
    "   - `applymap()`: Applies a custom function to every element in a DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "8. Filtering Data:\n",
    "   - Filter rows in a DataFrame using boolean indexing.\n",
    "   - Use comparison operators (<, >, ==) to create conditions.\n",
    "   - Combine multiple conditions using logical operators (& for 'and', | for 'or').\n",
    "\n",
    "9. Setting the Index:\n",
    "   - Use `set_index()` to set an index for the DataFrame.\n",
    "\n",
    "10. Adding/Removing Rows and Columns:\n",
    "   - Use `concat()` to add rows to the DataFrame.\n",
    "   - Use `drop()` with the row index/label to remove specific rows.\n",
    "   - Use bracket notation or `drop()` with axis=1 to add/remove columns."
