Statistical knowledge helps you use the proper methods to collect the data, employ the correct analyses, and effectively present the results.

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "> Analysts frequently use the mean to summarize the center of a population or a process. While the mean is relevant, people often react to variability even more. When a distribution has lower variability, the values in a dataset are more consistent. However, when the variability is higher, the data points are more dissimilar and extreme values become more likely. Consequently, **understanding variability helps you grasp the likelihood of unusual events**."
